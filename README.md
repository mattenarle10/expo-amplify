## What You Get

✅ **Email auth** with OTP verification  
✅ **Session persistence** across app restarts  
✅ **GraphQL API** with real-time sync  
✅ **Auto-created user profiles** via Lambda triggers  
✅ **Works in Expo Go** (the secret: `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow)

**Stack**: React Native · Expo · TypeScript · AWS Cognito · AppSync · DynamoDB




## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx ampx sandbox --profile <your-aws-profile>  # Terminal 1
npx expo start                                   # Terminal 2
# Scan QR → Open in Expo Go → Done ✨
```

## 🧹 Cleaning up the sandbox

```bash
# Delete the sandbox for this app (same profile you used to create it)
npx ampx sandbox delete --profile <your-aws-profile>

# If you used a named sandbox identifier
npx ampx sandbox delete --name <your-sandbox-name> --profile <your-aws-profile>
```

> **Note**: This only deletes the Amplify sandbox resources for this project, not other environments or AWS resources in your account.

## 📁 Key Files

```
app/(auth)/          # Sign in/up screens
amplify/auth/        # Cognito config + Lambda triggers
amplify/data/        # GraphQL schema
amplify_outputs.json # Auto-generated (gitignored)
```

> **Production tip**: Switch to `USER_SRP_AUTH` with a native build for enhanced security.
